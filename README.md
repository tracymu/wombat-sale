wombat-sale
===========

Building a scraper to automatically run and email me when my boots go on sale. Using wombat

What I need to do now is understand how to make it run regularly

Then I need to make it email me when it has changed


Future: it would be good if I could record the current price at first run, and then tell when that changes 
(rather than how I hard coded the current price in)

It would also be good if I could make some variables for path, so I can do it on different folders. 
This would also require product number to be a variable I guess.
